Version: 0.1.0
Author: Babatunde Alli
Maintainer: Babatunde Alli <babatunde.alli@mail.mcgill.ca>
Description: Produces a publication-ready table that includes all 
    effect estimates neccessary for full reporting effect modification 
    or interaction analysis as recommended by Knol and Vanderweele (2012) [<https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/2/514/692957>]. It also estimates confidence interval for 
    the trio of additive interaction measures using the delta method (see Hosmer and Lemeshow (1992), [<https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/1992/09000/Confidence_Interval_Estimation_of_Interaction.12.aspx>]), 
    variance recovery method (see Zou (2008), [<https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/168/2/212/100828>]), or bootstrapping (see Assmann et al. (1996), [<doi:10.1097/00001648-199605000-00012>] ).
